				<h3>Scenery</h3>
				<p>People go about their everyday life forgetting about the world that they live in and the many things nature has. This website hopes to open your eyes and so that you can take a closer look at the great things hiding right in front of you. </p>
				<hr>
				<p>Fact #1: Every second there is part of the rainforest that is cut down. In fact, you probably lose over 80,000 football fields worth of rainforest each and every day.</p>
        <p>Fact #2: Less than one percent of the species of plants in the tropical rainforests have actually been analyzed to determine their value in the world of medicine.</p>
